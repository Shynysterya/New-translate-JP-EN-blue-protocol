# New-translate-JP-EN-blue-protocol
An alternative English translation for the Japanese blue protocol
I did these steps like the normal tutorial
Unpack downloaded archive on ‚Å†announcements
Move "dinput8.dll" file from the archive, to "BLUEPROTOCOL\Binaries\Win64" folder. (use the new dinput8.dll , is in the downloads)
Make sure to delete "~mods" folder in "BLUEPROTOCOL\Content\Paks" folder.
Move "~mods" folder from the archive, to "BLUEPROTOCOL\Content\Paks" folder.
Move "server-patch" folder from the archive, to any location convenient for you

note: These files will also be necessary for the translation to work.
pakchunk0-WindowsClient.sig
6.09 KB

pakchunk0-WindowsClient_0_P.sig
49.36 KB - is added to the set of files


It is necessary to include these 2 files in the mods folder in BLUEPROTOCOL\Content\Paks , inside the mods folder


PS: i will add down below a custom dinput8.dll, exactly the same from the one used in the mod created by ArtFect, but without the error message so you don't have to bother close that pop up.
